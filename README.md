# Red Rabbit

This is an example mobile game for iOS took from the book "Building Android Games with Cocos2d". This is not a typo,
the book is oriented to Android users. Some minimal changes are required. 

To build the game, you need a prebuilt version of cocos installed besides the directory of the game. In my setup 
this folder is cocos2d-x-3.17. There are a couple of guides that explain how to do this. It is very simple.
